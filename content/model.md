# Key model parameters 

1) *Projections are based on the reported daily hospital census for Ottawa.*  

    - Census is defined as the number of hospitalized patients each day  

    - Daily hospital use reported by Ottawa Public Health. There is discussion to incorporate regional data rather than just cases from Ottawa hospitals. 

    - Doubling time (time it takes for the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to double) of 3 days from March 17 to 25, 2020. Projections initialized with a 4-day hospital doubling time. 

3) *Projections are based on the [CHIME model](https://penn-chime.phl.io/) v1.1.2 developed by the University of Pennsylvania Health System.* The projections can be updated for other models. 

4) *Model parameters other than Ottawa hospital use are aligned with [COVID-19-MC](https://www.covid-19-mc.ca/interactive-model) and [Tuite, Fisman, et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042705v1) models where possible, with updates based on [Verity et al. (Lancet, March 20, 2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30243-7/fulltext)* and [Ferguson et al. (March 16, 2020)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf).
