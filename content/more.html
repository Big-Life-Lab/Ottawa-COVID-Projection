<h2>Model accuracy</h2>
<p>Projecting the spread COVID-19 is like forecasting hurricanes. Projections are updated with the latest data, including local data to help understand when and where the hurricane will reach landfall.</p>
<p>We can’t reliably forecast the weather six months out, and we can’t forecast COVID-19 six months out. However, we can reliably forecast COVID-19 two to four weeks into the future. Those short-term projections give us time to plan and increase health-care resources as needed.</p>
<p>That being said, hurricanes and COVID-19 are not the same. We can’t prevent a hurricane from reaching the shore or changing its direction. However, we can change the impact of COVID-19 on our local communities through preventative measures like physical distancing.</p>
<p>Long-range COVID-19 projections provide information on the effectiveness of physical distancing and other preventive measures.</p>

<div id="scenarios-of-physical-distancing" class="section level2">
<h2>Scenarios of physical distancing</h2>
<p>Physical distancing and other preventive measures are the most important factors for projecting long-range (1 to 10 months) COVID-19 cases and hospital use.</p>
<p>Public Health Ontario projected 100,000 COVID-19 Ontario deaths with no preventative measures and a lower estimate of 3,000 deaths with preventive measures This wide range of estimates (100,000 to 3,000 deaths) reflects different levels of physical distancing.</p>
<p>A high level of physical distancing will achieve a <strong>97% reduction in deaths</strong> compared to a scenario of no preventive action (100,000 deaths). The wide range in projections is why we need to monitor and update Ottawa projections to reflect how well we achieve COVID-19 prevention.</p>

<div id="what-is-physical-distancing" class="section level2">
<h2>What is physical distancing</h2>
<p>Physical distancing is the reduction of close contacts between people. Close contact is defined as being within two meters of another person.</p>
<p>If a person who had close contact with 10 people per day before the COVID-19 pandemic now has close contact with three people per day, their physical distancing score is 70 percent. If they have contact with five people per day, their score is 50 percent.</p>
<p>In these projection models, a 70 percent physical distancing scenario means that on average the people of Ottawa have reduced their close contacts by 70 percent. Some people, like essential workers, cannot reduce their number of close contacts.</p>

<div id="flatten-the-curve" class="section level2">
<h2>Flatten the curve</h2>
<p>Flattening the curve means preventing a sharp peak of cases, and spreading the infection rate over a longer period of time so that the health-care system is not overwhelmed. To understand how to flatten the curve, we first need to understand how the curve develops.</p>
<p>There are three parts of the curve:</p>
<p>the first part of the curve that sweeps upward. An epidemic spreads through a community by infecting people who are susceptible to infection. If an infected person comes into contact with many people who aren’t infected, the infection will spread quickly.</p>
<p>the second part of the curve that levels. An epidemic will slow as the number of susceptible people decreases or preventive measures slow the spread.</p>
<p>The third part of the curve that descends downward as fewer and fewer people develop COVID-19.</p>
<p>Because COVID-19 is a new virus, the entire population was susceptible to COVID-19 infection at the beginning of the outbreak. Flattening the curve is slowing the spread amongst people who are susceptible to COVID-19.</p>
