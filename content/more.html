<h1>Physical Distancing</h1>
<p>Physical distancing is the reduction of physical contact between people. You have a 70% reduction in physical distancing if pre-COVID-19 you had close contact with 10 people per day and you reduce your contact to 3 people per day.</p>
<p>A 70% physical distancing scenario means the people in Ottawa have an average 70% reduction in their person-to-person contact. Some people, such as essential workers, will not be able to reduce their contact as much as others. This means that non-essential contact needs to have a higher reduction than essential contact.</p>
