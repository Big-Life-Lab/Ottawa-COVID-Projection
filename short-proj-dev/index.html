<p>Short-term projections are the most accurate estimate current covid-19 transmission in the community. Similar to a weather forecast, short-term projections predict changes in the near future; while long-term projections predict show a more general trend with less accuracy. Sometimes short-term &amp; long-term projections can contradict one another. Short-term projections are more sensitive to immediate changes; while long-term projections require sustained trends before projections change.</p>
<p>The following plots illustrate short-term projections for Ottawa. These plots include projected cases by episode date, projected cases by reporting date, and projected reproduction number. Following, long-term projections are presented.</p>
