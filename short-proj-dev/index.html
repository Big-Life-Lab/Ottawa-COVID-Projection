<p>Short-term and long-term covid-19 projections are presented below. See <a href="more">More</a> for a discussion about model interpretation and <a href="methods">Methods</a> for how the projections where created. Short-term projections reflect current covid-19 transmission; while long-term projections reflect sustained transmission trends. Short-term and long-term projections can trend in different directions when there are changing patterns of community covid-19 transmission.</p>
