      <description>Projections are based on the reported daily hospital census for Ottawa.
 Daily hospital use reported by Ottawa Public Health.  Model parameters other than Ottawa hospital use are aligned with other models.
 Model parameters are described below.
 Parameter estimates are from COVID-19-MC and Tuite, Fisman, et al. models where possible, with updates based on Verity et al. (Lancet, March 20, 2020)* and Ferguson et al.</description>

      <description>Model use There are two main uses of the projections:
Short-term projections (2 to 4 weeks) to inform the immediate need for hospital and critical care services for COVID-19 patients.
 Long-term projections (6 weeks onward) to assess the effect of relaxing physical distancing.
   Model accuracy Creating accurate, long-range projections to predict the spread COVID-19 is difficult. It’s akin to forecasting when a hurricane will make landfall when it is still thousands of kilometers out at sea.</description>

      <description>Dashboard Data to 2020-10-05
Current 806 active cases in Ottawa.
26 confirmed COVID-19 patients in hospital.
Including: 21 acute care patients. 5 ICU patients.

      <description>The National Capital Region is one of the first communities in Canada to conduct daily wastewater readings to help inform its community response in the fight against COVID-19, thanks to innovative research from the CHEO Research Institute (CHEO RI) and the University of Ottawa (uOttawa).
The figures below were created by researchers at CHEO RI and uOttawa. Learn more about wastewater epidemiology and its role in covid-19 surveillance on Ottawa Public Health’s website.</description>
