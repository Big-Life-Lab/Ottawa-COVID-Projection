      <description>Projections are based on the reported daily hospital census for Ottawa.
 Census is defined as the number of hospitalized patients each day
 Daily hospital use reported by Ottawa Public Health. There is discussion to incorporate regional data rather than just cases from Ottawa hospitals.
 Doubling time (time it takes for the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to double) of 3 days from March 17 to 25, 2020.</description>

      <description>Model use There are two main uses of the projections:
Short-term projections (2 to 4 weeks) to inform the immediate need for hospital and critical care services for COVID-19 patients.
 Long-term projections (6 weeks to 10 months) to assess how to ‘flatten the curve’.
   Model accuracy Creating accurate, long-range projections to predict the spread COVID-19 is difficult. It’s akin to forecasting when a hurricane will make landfall when it is still thousands of kilometers out at sea.</description>

      <description> The main purpose of this site is to visualize Ottawa-based projections for models performed by other teams.
 Review and update model parameters based on recent published studies. Priories for review:  ventilated patients deaths  Add plot for observed hospital census trend, with estimated doubling time.  </description>
