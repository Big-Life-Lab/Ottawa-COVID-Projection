      <description>Key model parametersProjections are based on the reported daily hospital census for Ottawa.
Census is defined as the number of hospitalized patients each day
Daily hospital use reported by Ottawa Public Health. There is discussion to incorporate regional data rather than just cases from Ottawa hospitals.
Doubling time (time it takes for the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients to double) of 3 days from March 17 to 25, 2020.</description>

      <description>Physical DistancingPhysical distancing is the reduction of close contacts between people. Close contact is defined as being within two meters of another person.
If a person who had close contact with 10 people per day before the COVID-19 pandemic now has close contact with three people per day, their physical distancing score is 70 percent. If they have contact with five people per day, their score is 50 percent.</description>
