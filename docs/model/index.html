<h2>Projections based on daily hospital census</h2>
<p>Ottawa COVID-19 projections augment the projections of Public Health Ontario and other models by incorporating local reported hospitalizations since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The use of local hospitalization rates follows the analogy of forecasting hurricanes. We monitor the local hospital COVID-19 use and then project the trend into the future based on the knowledge of COVID-19 and how it spreads in communities.</p>
</div>
<div id="physical-distancing" class="section level2">
<h2>The importance of physical distancing</h2>
<p>The trend of COVID-19 hospital use is summarized as “doubling time.” Doubling time — and the weekly change in doubling time — are the most important parameters in COVID-19 projections that vary between communities.</p>
<p>An exponential growth in hosptial census (doubling time of less than 4 days) will occur unless one of two situations occurs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The number of people susceptible to infection decreases. As an epidemic progresses, there will be fewer people left in the community who can become infected. However, as of Jun 21, 2020 only a small proportion of people living in Ottawa are currently infected or are recovered from COVID-19 – likely less than 1%. This means that the current reduction in susceptible people has a negligible effect effect on changes to hospital infection doubling times. Approximately 50 to 60% of people need to be immune to COVID-19 (infected or recovered) before doubling time becomes negative – meaning there is a weekly decrease in the patients in hospital.</p></li>
<li><p>Preventive measures slow the spread of infection.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first situation — how doubling time decreases as the number of susceptible people decreases — can be easily modelled using mathematical formulas.</p>
<p>The second situation — the effectiveness of preventive measures — is more difficult to estimate accurately. Prevention and control measures depend not only on what measures are in place over the last 2-4 weeks, but also how well people follow the measures. Current hospital use and trends in hosptial use provide important information on physical distancing effectiveness and other measures to control the spread of COVID-19 infection.</p>
</div>
<div id="distancing-math" class="section level2">
<h2>How physical distancing affects COVID-19 projections</h2>
<p>The projections of hospital cases uses an <span class="math inline">\(SIR\)</span> model (<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> = susceptible, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> = infected, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> = recovered people). Within an SIR model,
new infections at time (<span class="math inline">\(t+1\)</span>) are equal to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_{t+1} = \beta S_t I_t \]</span>
Where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is commonly referred as the “force of infection” because it describes how quickly a disease can move through a population. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is a probability or risk that ranges from 0 to 1. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> value = 0.5 means 50% of susceptible people (<span class="math inline">\(S_t\)</span>) who are in contact with an infected person (<span class="math inline">\(I_t\)</span>) will become infected (<span class="math inline">\(I_{t+1}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Physical distancing is a ‘control measure’ to reduce the effective force of infection, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. A control measure, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> reduces new infections, where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 1\)</span> results in a complete disruption in new infections (conversely, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0\)</span> has no effect for reducing new infections). The projections presented on this website assume physical distancing is directly related to effective control. This means 50% physical distancing is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.5\)</span>. <span class="citation">Daughton et al. (<a href="#ref-daughton2017approach" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span></p>
<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is related to the epidemiology measure <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> - the basic reproductive number that describes the expected number of people who become infected with from each person with COVID-19 at the beginning of an outbreak. <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the reciprocal of the infectious period (<span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="distancing" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculating physical distancing effectiveness</h2>
<p>Physical distancing effectiveness is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, for the calculations on this website. In practice, contract tracing and isolation is the other main control measure. The effect of contract tracing was not separated from physical distancing.</p>
<p>Physical distancing effectiveness, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda = 1 - \frac{(g + \gamma)}{\beta_0}\]</span>
Where,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the observed growth rate, expressed the rate of new COVID-19 cases each day.
<span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the force of infection at the beginning of the outbreak. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = 0.332\)</span> when doubling time <span class="math inline">\(D_t = 4\)</span> days (or growth rate at the beginning of the outbreak, <span class="math inline">\(g_0 = 0.189\)</span>). In turn, <span class="math inline">\(g_0\)</span> is derived from a basic reproduction number (<span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>) of 2.32 and mean generation interval (<span class="math inline">\(T_c\)</span>) of 7 days, where,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_0 = \frac{R_0 - 1}{T_c}\]</span>
or,</p>
