summaryDescription,"Summary: May 11, 2021, Ottawa wastewater shows prevalence of B.1.1.7 and low confidence detection of B.1.617+ lineages. Two weeks prior, high confidence detection of B.1.617+ lineages was observed. No other VOC/VOI were identified above the level of detection of the assay."

detailedDescription2,"The second sequencing run performed on Ottawa wastewater in as many weeks revealed continued prevalence of B.1.1.7 and low confidence detection of B.1.617+ lineages. Two weeks prior, high confidence detection of B.1.617+ lineages was observed. No other VOC/VOI were identified above the level of detection of the assay."
detailedDescription3,"The assembled consensus community genome (i.e., most frequent metagenome observed) was consistent with genomes of the B.1.1.7 lineage (aka UK variant) with 83.5% genome coverage at >5X read depth. The mean depth of coverage across the community genome was 493X."
detailedDescription4,16 out of 17 mutations associated with B.1.1.7 genomes were present in the community genome.
detailedDescription5,"Of every 100 reads that overlapped sites of B.1.1.7 mutation, approx. 90 were found to harbour B.1.1.7 mutations. This is consistent with a sample where the major proportion of contributing viral RNA can be assigned to the B.1.1.7 lineage."
detailedDescription6,"The May 11 sample contained fewer reads that could be associated with the B.1.617 lineages than in the April 25 sample. 3 out of 11-17 mutations associated with these lineages were observed including Orf7a:V82A, Orf7a:T20I, N:R203M, but at frequencies below that needed for confident assignment to the B.1.617+ lineages."
detailedDescription7,There was insufficient evidence to support the presence of any other VOC/VOI above the level of detection of the assay.
