      <description>Described below is a brief description of methods, data and model parameters used at 613covid.ca. More detailed information can be found in the accompanying references.
Projection models All data used to create projection models can be accessed at Open Ottawa. See ’COVID-19 cases and deaths`.
Covid-19 short-term projections are created using the Bayesian EpiNow2 model developed by the EpiForecasts team.
 Projections are based on observed covid-19 cases by reporting date, which is, in turn, estimated using reported incubation period and consideration for reporting delays.</description>

      <description>Model use There are two main uses of the projections:
Short-term projections (1 to 4 weeks) reflect the current level of covid-19 transmssion and current effectivess of ongoing covid-19 prevention and control. Short-term projections the immediate need health care such hospital and critical care services for COVID-19 patients.
 Long-term projections (6 weeks onward) reflect sustain trends in covid-19 transmissions. Long-term projections are helpful to assess the potiential effect of covid-19 re-opening or the need of increased restrictions to control surges.</description>

      <description>The National Capital Region is the first community in Canada to conduct and report daily wastewater readings of SARS-CoV-2 viral signal to help inform its community response in the fight against covid-19, thanks to innovative research from the CHEO Research Institute and the University of Ottawa.
People with covid-19 shed the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool, regardless of whether they have symptoms, receive a covid-19 test or ever are diagnosed.</description>

      <description>Dashboard (part of the main page dashboard)
Case halving time: 22.4 days
 Introduction (text will go after observed data)
Short-term and long-term covid-19 projections are presented below. See More for a discussion about model interpretation and Methods for how the projections where created. Short-term projections reflect current covid-19 transmission; while long-term projections reflect sustained transmission trends. Short-term and long-term projections can trend in different directions when there are changing patterns of community covid-19 transmission.</description>
