      <description>Described below is a brief description of methods, data and model parameters used at 613covid.ca. More detailed information can be found in the accompanying references.
Projection models All data used to create projection models can be accessed at Open Ottawa. See ’COVID-19 cases and deaths`.
Covid-19 case projections created using the Bayesian SEIR model developed by Simon Fraser University.
 Projections are based on observed covid-19 cases by episode date.</description>

      <description>Model use There are two main uses of the projections:
Short-term projections (2 to 4 weeks) inform the current level of covid-19 transmssion. In turn, current covid-19 transmission reflects effectivess of ongoing covid-19 prevention and control. Short-term projections the immediate need health care such hospital and critical care services for COVID-19 patients.
 Long-term projections (6 weeks onward) to assess the potential effect of changes in covid-19 transmission. In turn, future covid-19 transmission reflects potential changes to covid-19 re-opening stages and the effectiveness of cvoid prevention and control.</description>

      <description>The National Capital Region is the first community in Canada to conduct and report daily wastewater readings of SARS-CoV-2 viral signal to help inform its community response in the fight against covid-19, thanks to innovative research from the CHEO Research Institute and the University of Ottawa.
People with covid-19 shed the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus in their stool, regardless of whether they have symptoms, receive a covid-19 test or ever are diagnosed.</description>

 Introduction (text will go after observed data)
Short-term projections are the most accurate estimate current covid-19 transmission in the community. Similar to a weather forecast, short-term projections predict changes in the near future; while long-term projections predict show a more general trend with less accuracy. Sometimes short-term &amp;amp; long-term projections can contradict one another.</description>
