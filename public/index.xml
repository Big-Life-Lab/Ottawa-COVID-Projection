  Census is defined as the number of hospitalized patients each day
  Daily hospital use reported by Ottawa Public Health. There is discussion to incorporate regional data rather than just cases from Ottawa hospitals.

      <description>Physical Distancing Physical distancing is the reduction of physical contact between people. You have a 70% reduction in physical distancing if pre-COVID-19 you had close contact with 10 people per day and you reduce your contact to 3 people per day.
A 70% physical distancing scenario means the people in Ottawa have an average 70% reduction in their person-to-person contact. Some people, such as essential workers, will not be able to reduce their contact as much as others.</description>
